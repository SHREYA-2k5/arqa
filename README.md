## Food Wastage in India


- Despite being one of the world’s leading producers of food, India continues to struggle with malnutrition, which remains one of the leading causes of death and disability, claiming around 3,000 lives daily, According to Global Burden of Disease Study, 2017.
- India leads in the production of milk, pulses and jute and ranks second in rice, wheat and other crops. It is also a top producer of spices, fish and poultry, yet it faces this crisis because of food wastage.

- According to a 2018 study, 1⁄3 of our produced food gets wasted every year.




 

- 40% of food waste in institutions are not from students throwing away food, but rather the surplus food that needs to be thrown away. Our app aims to reduce this surplus to reduce food wastage as a whole.

## Key Features:
- Students: They can pre-book meals, which notifies the hostels just how much to produce. Frequent Bookings will give the user credits, which can later be redeemed for free food.
  
- Hostels: AI will generate reports for the admin and will suggest changes to menu based on popularity analysis and ingredient costs. The platform will also generate a predictive shopping list for the admin based on previous week's order statistics.
  
- NGOs: Verified surplus food cannn be donated to nearby NGOs with geofenced notifications
  
- Our major goal is to reduce waste by 60-75% through AI reports
  
Other aims:
- We want to reduce institutional food costs, Improve student food security, Channel surplus food to local communities and reduces the overall environmental footprint.
